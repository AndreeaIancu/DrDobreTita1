# DrDobreTita1
Single Screen App

I decided to dedicate this project to my daughter's doctor who has recently helped us get better after a serious pneumonia episode.
I couldn't get a picture of our doctor so I used a placeholder image I found online. I hope that is accepted.
I also wanted to place a faded / semi-transparent background image but was unable to get it to work without 
fading the entire content so I just used a simple color instead. I could use some help/ advice with using mipmaps or bitmap.xml.
So far I managed to use the Vector Asset Studio for drawables as one of my fellow students (jck) recommended on Slack. 
Here is the link he sent me, it helped a lot:

What I noticed was that the drawablesTint did not work properly on one of my older phones. 
The icons simply remained with their default black color.

Any feedback and improvement suggestion is much appreciated.
